# Predictive Maintenance and Machine Health Monitoring
The rising of new technology i.e, Internet of Things, heavy industry has started adopting sensor-based data collection to solve its biggest challenges, principal among them process downtime in the form of shutdowns and process delays.
Machine monitoring also called predictive maintenance or condition monitoring is the practice of monitoring electrical equipment through sensors in order to accumulate diagnostic data. To achieve this, data acquisition systems and data loggers are used to monitor all kinds of equipment, such as boilers, motors, and engines.
Following condition are measured:
- Temperature and Humidity Data Monitoring
- Current and Voltage Monitoring
- Vibration Monitoring
In this article, we will read Temperature,vibration and publish the data on Ubidots.  Ubidots supports graphs, UI, notifications, and emails.  These features make it ideal for predictive maintenance analysis. We will also get the data in google sheets which will make predictive maintenance analysis more easier.

- [ Long Range Wireless Mesh Modem with USB Interface](https://store.ncd.io/product/900hp-s3b-long-range-wireless-mesh-modem-with-usb-interface/)

Software Used:
- Arduino IDE
- [Ubidot](https://ubidots.com/)

Library Used:
- PubSubClient Library
- Wire.h

# Arduino Client for MQTT
This library provides a client for doing simple publish/subscribe messaging with a server that supports MQTT

For more information about MQTT, visit [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org/).
## Download
The latest version of the library can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/releases/tag/v2.7)
## Documentation
The library comes with a number of example sketches. See File > Examples > PubSubClient within the Arduino application.
Full [API Documentation](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html).
## Compatible Hardware
The library uses the Arduino Ethernet Client api for interacting with the underlying network hardware. This means it Just Works with a growing number of boards and shields, including:

- Arduino Ethernet
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- Arduino YUN – use the included YunClient in place of EthernetClient, and be sure to do a Bridge.begin() first
- Arduino WiFi Shield - if you want to send packets greater than 90 bytes with this shield, enable the [MQTT_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE]  (https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html#configoptions) option in   PubSubClient.h.
- Sparkfun WiFly Shield – when used with [this](https://github.com/dpslwk/WiFly) library
- Intel Galileo/Edison
- ESP8266
- ESP32
The library cannot currently be used with hardware based on the ENC28J60 chip – such as the Nanode or the Nuelectronics Ethernet Shield. For those, there is an alternative library available.

# Wire Library
  The Wire library allows you to communicate with I2C devices, often also called "2 wire" or "TWI" (Two Wire Interface),can download  from [Wire.h](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Wire)
## Basic Usage
- Wire.begin()
  Begin using Wire in master mode, where you will initiate and control data transfers. This is the most common use when interfacing with   most I2C peripheral chips.

- Wire.begin(address)
  Begin using Wire in slave mode, where you will respond at "address" when other I2C masters chips initiate communication.
  
 ## Transmitting
 - Wire.beginTransmission(address)
   Start a new transmission to a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.write(data)
  Send data. In master mode, beginTransmission must be called first.

- Wire.endTransmission()
  In master mode, this ends the transmission and causes all buffered data to be sent.
  
## Receiving
- Wire.requestFrom(address, count)
  Read "count" bytes from a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.available()
  Retuns the number of bytes available by calling receive.

- Wire.read()
  Receive 1 byte.

# Steps to send data to Labview vibration and temperature platform using IoT Long Range Wireless Vibration And Temperature Sensor and  Long Range Wireless Mesh Modem with USB Interface-

- First, we need a Labview utility application which is [ncd.io Wireless Vibration and Temperature Sensor.exe](https://github.com/ncdcommunity/Industrial-IoT-Vibration-Temperature-Sensor) file on which data can be viewed.

- This Labview software will work with ncd.io wireless Vibration Temperature sesnor only

- To use this UI, you will need to install following drivers Install run time engine from here [64bit](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2017/6821/en/)

- [32 bit](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2017/6822/en/)

- Install [NI Visa Driver](http://www.ni.com/download/ni-visa-run-time-engine/6647/en/)

- Install [LabVIEW Run-Time Engine]( http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2017-sp1/7191/en/) and [NI-Serial Runtime]  (http://www.ni.com/download/ni-serial-17.0/6613/en/)

- [Getting started guide for this product.](https://ncd.io/long-range-iot-wireless-vibration-sensor-getting-started/)


##  Uploading the code  to ESP32 using Arduino IDE:
- **Download and include the PubSubClient Library and Wire.h Library.**
- **You must assign your unique Ubidots TOKEN, MQTTCLIENTNAME, SSID (WiFi Name) and Password of the available network.**
- **Compile and upload the  [Ncd__vibration_and_temperature.ino](https://github.com/mjScientech/https-github.com-mjScientech-ESP32-AND-SI7021/blob/master/Ncd__vibration_and_temperature.ino) code.**
- **To verify the connectivity of the device and the data sent, open the serial monitor.If no response is seen, try unplugging your ESP32 and then plugging it again. Make sure the baud rate of the Serial monitor is set to the same one specified in your code 115200.**

## Serial monitor output.

## Making the Ubidot work:
- **Create the account on [Ubidot](https://ubidots.com/).**
- **Go to my profile and note down the token key which is a unique key for every account and paste it to your ESP32 code before uploading.**
- **Add a new device to your ubidot dashboard name esp32.**
  
![alt tag](https://github.com/mjScientech/Esp32-And-SHT30/blob/master/device234.JPG)

                       Click on devices and select devices in ubidot.

![alt tag](https://github.com/mjScientech/ESP32-AND-SI7021/blob/master/Device.JPG)

     Now you should see the published data in your Ubidots account, inside the device called "ESP32".

- **Inside device create new variable name sensor in which your temperature reading will be shown.**
![alt tag](https://github.com/mjScientech/ESP32-AND-SI7021/blob/master/variable.JPG)
                  
![alt tag](https://github.com/mjScientech/-predictive-machine-monitoring-system-using-Ubidots-and-Long-Range-Wireless-Vibration-And-Temp/blob/master/variable1.PNG) 

    Now you are able to view the Temperature and other sensors data which was previously viewed in the serial monitor. This
    happened because the value of different sensor readings is passed as a string and store in variable and publish to a variable inside     device esp32. 
- **Create dashboard in ubidots**
![alt tag](https://github.com/mjScientech/https-github.com-mjScientech-ESP32-AND-SI7021/blob/master/dashboard1.JPG)
       
          Go to data select dashboard and inside dashboard create different widgets and add new widget 
          to your dashboard screen.
# OUTPUT
- **Now as the temperature/vibration  increases and decreases new data available inside the various variable.**

# Export your Ubidots data to Google Sheets
In this we can extract the data stored in the Ubidots cloud for further analysis.The possibilities are enormous; for instance, you could create an automatic report generator and send it to your customers every week.

Another application would be device provisioning; if you have thousands of devices to deploy, and their information is in a Google Sheet, you could create a script to read the sheet and create a Ubidots data source for every line on the file.
**Steps to do this-**
- Create a Google Sheet and add two sheets to it with these names:

1. Variables
2. Values
- From your Google Sheet, click on "Tools" then "Script Editor...", then "Blank Project":

- Open the Script Editor:
[![alt tag](https://github.com/ncdcommunity/predective-machine-monitoring-system-using-ubidots/blob/master/googlesheet1.png)
- Add the code below (in the code section) to the script 
[Script](https://github.com/mjScientech/-predictive-machine-monitoring-system-using-Ubidots-and-Long-Range-Wireless-Vibration-And-Temp/blob/master/script%20code.txt)
- Done! now open your Google Sheet again and you'll see a new menu to trigger the functions:
